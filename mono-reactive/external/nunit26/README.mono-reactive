(Note that I edited nunit-console.exe config slightly from the binary
distribution.)

You can either run "make" or open mono-reactive.sln in MonoDevelop and run
System.Reactive.Tests.dll (as an NUnit test project).

You can alternatively run nunit-console.exe on .NET Framework; just edit
Makefile and add # prefix to "RUNTIME = mono" line to comment it out.
